Blind 75 LeetCode Questions.

I have tried to solve all the quesitions of Blind 75 LeetCode for DSA prep. I have used simple ways to solve all the problems rather than using complex ways. Complex ways may make code shorter and hard to grasp. That's why for my understanding and for others newbiews I have used simple codes.

I am confortable in JS, Java, C++ & Python, for this I have solved all the quesitions using these different languages. I have some intrest in C, for this, I have also included that.

I am not a well polised DSA person, This is for my self learning & others also. Any suggesitions appriciated.

Every quesitions comes in a folder named exactly the leetcode title & in that folder Multiple solution folders can be respective to the language.
